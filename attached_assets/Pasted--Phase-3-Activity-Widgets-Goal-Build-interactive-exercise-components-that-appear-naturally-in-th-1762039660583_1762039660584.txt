📋 Phase 3: Activity Widgets
Goal: Build interactive exercise components that appear naturally in the chat
Step 3.1: Create ActivityWrapper Component
Build /components/ActivityWrapper.jsx:

This is a container that appears as a special message in the chat
Has a subtle background to distinguish from regular messages
Shows activity title and instructions
Contains the specific activity type (fill-in-blank, matching, etc.)
Has "Submit" button at bottom
Shows feedback after submission

Styling:

Light background (#F5F5F5)
Subtle border (not harsh)
Padding: 16px
Rounded corners: 12px

Step 3.2: Create FillInBlank Component
Build /components/activities/FillInBlank.jsx:
Features:

Displays a sentence with gaps: "I ___ to the store yesterday."
Input fields for each gap (inline with sentence)
Submit button
Shows correct/incorrect feedback with color coding (green checkmark, red X)
Option to "Try Again" or "See Answer"

Example Data Structure:
javascriptconst exerciseData = {
  type: "fill-in-blank",
  sentence: "I ___ to the store yesterday.",
  gaps: [
    { position: 1, correctAnswer: "went", userAnswer: "" }
  ],
  hint: "Think about past tense of 'go'"
}
Styling:

Input gaps: underlined space within sentence flow
Width adjusts based on expected answer length
Focus state: highlight current gap
Correct: green border, checkmark icon
Incorrect: red border, X icon

Step 3.3: Create MatchingGame Component
Build /components/activities/MatchingGame.jsx:
Features:

Two columns: "Words" and "Definitions"
Draggable word cards (or click-to-match on mobile)
Visual connection lines when matched
Submit button to check all answers
Color-coded feedback (green for correct pairs, red for incorrect)

Example Data Structure:
javascriptconst matchingData = {
  type: "matching",
  pairs: [
    { id: 1, word: "ephemeral", definition: "lasting for a very short time" },
    { id: 2, word: "ubiquitous", definition: "present everywhere" }
  ]
}
Interaction:

Mobile: tap word, tap definition → creates match
Desktop: drag word to definition OR click-to-match
Visual feedback: subtle highlight on hover/selection
Matched pairs: locked together with connecting line

Styling:

Cards: white background, shadow, rounded corners (8px)
Selected: blue border
Matched: green border with checkmark
Incorrect: red border with X

Step 3.4: Create FreePractice Component
Build /components/activities/FreePractice.jsx:
Features:

Prompt/question from AI
Large text area for user response
Character/word counter
Submit button
Display AI feedback as a follow-up message

Example:

Prompt: "Describe your morning routine. Try to use at least 5 different verbs."
Text area: expandable, minimum 3 lines
Counter: "45 words" (subtle, bottom-right)

Styling:

Text area: bordered, rounded, padding
Min height: 100px
Grows with content
Focus state: blue border highlight

CHECKPOINT: Test each activity type displays correctly and handles user interaction. Mock the "correct/incorrect" feedback for now.
