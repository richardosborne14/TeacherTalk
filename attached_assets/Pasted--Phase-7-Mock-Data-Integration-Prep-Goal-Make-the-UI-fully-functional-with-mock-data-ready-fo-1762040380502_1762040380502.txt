📋 Phase 7: Mock Data & Integration Prep
Goal: Make the UI fully functional with mock data, ready for backend integration
Step 7.1: Create Mock Data
Build /utils/mockData.js with:
Mock Conversation:
javascriptconst mockConversation = [
  {
    id: 1,
    sender: "ai",
    content: "Hi! I'm so excited to be your English teacher. What brings you here today?",
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    sender: "user",
    content: "I need to improve my grammar for work emails.",
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:31:00Z"
  },
  // ... more messages
]
Mock Activities:
javascriptconst mockActivities = {
  fillInBlank: {
    type: "fill-in-blank",
    sentence: "I ___ to the office every day by subway.",
    gaps: [{ position: 1, correctAnswer: "go" }],
    hint: "Present simple tense"
  },
  matching: {
    type: "matching",
    pairs: [
      { id: 1, word: "definitely", definition: "without doubt" },
      { id: 2, word: "probably", definition: "likely but not certain" }
    ]
  }
}
Mock Profile:
javascriptconst mockProfile = {
  currentLevel: "B1",
  streak: 5,
  lessonsCompleted: 12,
  skills: {
    listening: { level: "B1", progress: 75 },
    reading: { level: "A2", progress: 60 },
    writing: { level: "B1", progress: 40 },
    speaking: { level: "A2", progress: 80 }
  },
  badges: [
    { id: 1, title: "First Flight", icon: "🚀", earned: true },
    { id: 2, title: "7-Day Streak", icon: "🔥", earned: true },
    { id: 3, title: "Grammar Master", icon: "📚", earned: false }
  ]
}
Step 7.2: Create API Mock Functions
Build /utils/api.js with:
javascript// Simulate API delay
const delay = (ms) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

export const sendMessage = async (message) => {
  await delay(1000); // Simulate network delay
  // Return mock AI response
  return {
    id: Date.now(),
    sender: "ai",
    content: "That's a great goal! Let's start by...",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
};

export const submitActivity = async (activityData) => {
  await delay(800);
  // Return mock feedback
  return {
    correct: true,
    feedback: "Excellent work! You got it right."
  };
};

export const getProfile = async () => {
  await delay(500);
  return mockProfile;
};
Step 7.3: Wire Up Components
Connect all components to use mock data:

Chat displays mock conversation on load
Sending message calls mock API and adds response
Activities use mock data and feedback
Progress dashboard shows mock profile data

Prepare for Backend:

Keep API calls in /utils/api.js for easy replacement
Use clear naming for API endpoints
Document expected data shapes in comments

CHECKPOINT: The entire UI should function smoothly with mock data. Everything should look and feel complete, just waiting for the real AI backend.
